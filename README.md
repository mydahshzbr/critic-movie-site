critic. Movie Diary

This is a website where you can log the movies you watch, give them a star rating, and write a review. All the data is saved in a MongoDB database.

How to set this up on your computer:

1. Download and install Node.js and MongoDB.
2. Download these project files to your computer.
3. Open your Command Prompt in this folder.
4. Type "npm install" and press Enter. This will download the necessary tools.
5. Make sure your MongoDB is running.
6. Type "node server.js" and press Enter to start the server.
7. Open index.html in your browser.

Now you can save reviews, and they will be stored in your own local database.
